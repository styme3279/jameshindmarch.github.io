Here are some resources for learning more about mathematical logic. I took on the order of 4 courses on this field at Cambridge (3 of which were in Part III), and fortunately got the opportunity to write an essay on a topic in the field (try to imagine the nichest topic that could possibly exist in one of the nichest fields of mathematics, and go *even nicher*!) In any case, I hope someone takes an interest in this page to some degree, since I spent approximately half a year's worth of academic time working on these things.

## Logic and Set Theory

The first mathematical logic course I took was Logic and Set Theory, in Part II. This was both my favourite and best course that year. Unfortunately, I was not taking $$\latex$$ notes then, but there is a decent set of online notes which follows the course content well. [Here they are](/pdf_files/Logic_and_Set_Theory_NotMine.pdf).
