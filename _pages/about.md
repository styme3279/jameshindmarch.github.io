I went to King's College London Mathematics School in sixth form, which was probably one of the best experiences of my life. Then I went to the University of Cambridge to study maths (which I hope was *not* one of the best experiences of my life, dear God), although the friends I made there will hopefully be friends for life. Now I'm working on AI safety. I wonder what comes next?
