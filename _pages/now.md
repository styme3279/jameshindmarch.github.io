Currently I am living in London, working at the [LISA](https://www.safeai.org.uk) offices. I'm working for [ARENA](https://arena.education)

I'm currently working on content for the ARENA evals curriculum. The coding part of this is mostly done, so I'm now just beginning to write the actual resources. This will probably involve opening streamlit, excalidraw and figuring out markdown evene better, which is luckily also good for this website.

The playlist to the right is what I'm currently listening to 'On Repeat' according to Spotify. In my experience it has not been *entirely* accurate. Despite that, it definitely gets at something, and there is probably a 5% chance that I'll be listening to one of these songs at any given time you might be reading this.
