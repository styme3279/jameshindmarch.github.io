Currently I am living in London, working at the [LISA](https://www.safeai.org.uk) offices. I'm working for the [ARENA Programme](https://arena.education) (or maybe I *am* partially the ARENA program(?), if you look too close the corporate structure situation kind of falls apart), but we're a pretty good program â€“ arguably the best deep learning course in existence (and we're focused on AI safety, Hooray!).

I'm currently working on content for the ARENA evals curriculum. The coding part of this is mostly done right now, so I'm now just beginning to write the actual resources. This will probably involve opening streamlit, excalidraw and getting marginally better at markdown and html, which is luckily also good for this website.

The playlist to the right is what I'm currently listening to 'On Repeat' according to Spotify. In my experience it has not been *entirely* accurate. Despite that, it definitely gets at something, and there is probably a 5% chance that I'll be listening to one of these songs at any given time you might be reading this.
