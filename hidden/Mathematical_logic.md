Here are some resources for learning more about mathematical logic. I took on the order of 4 courses on this field at Cambridge (3 of which were in Part III), and fortunately got the opportunity to write an essay on a topic in the field (try to imagine the nichest topic that could possibly exist in one of the nichest fields of mathematics, and go *even nicher*!) In any case, I'm naively hopeful that someone might take an interest in this page to some degree, since I spent approximately a year's worth of rather intense academic time working on these things. Oh well, I guess it pales in comparison to a PhD.

## Logic and Set Theory

The first mathematical logic course I took was [Logic and Set Theory](/pdf_files/Logic_and_Set_Theory_NotMine.pdf), in Part II. This was both my favourite and best course that year. Unfortunately, I was not taking $$\LaTeX$$ notes then, but the online notes follow the course content reasonably well. I'll give some thoughts and highlights below.

### Compactness/Completeness

I think the completeness and compactness theorems are definitely up there (although, the analogy between the compactness theorem of mathematical logic, and compactness in topology is the pure maths equivalent of the [Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy)/[Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) distinction, if you want to know the rough reason for this naming 'confusion', look at [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%27s_representation_theorem_for_Boolean_algebras)). There's something so powerful about the fact that proofs *have* to be finite, that should be obvious from the moment you start learning what proofs are, but doesn't hit you over the head until you understand the compactness theorem. It's also just incredibly cool that Gödel showed we can always build a complete model for any consistent theory. At first glance, this theorem seemed more important than Gödel's incompleteness theorems, but later when I took Set Theory courses I realized that was not the case, and the incompleteness theorems have claimed their place rightfully (though the completeness theorem remainds underrated).

### Ordinals
As a first introduction to ordinals, this is heavy-going but great. A particular highlight would be the proof that the collection of ordinals don't form a set, and Hartogs' Lemma. Also this forms the basis of almost all future set theory, and serves a great foundation to work from.

### Cardinals
The course is pretty light on cardinals. It basically tells you what an aleph number is, and how addition and multiplication differs from ordinals. It's argubaly justified, since it's hard to say anything about cardinals beyond the obvious things (thanks a lot $$2^{\aleph_{0}}$$). Although I feel like König's theorem probably could have been introduced and proven, especially if you're gonna mention cardinal exponentiation, since that's just about the only thing we *can* say about cardinal exponentiation.

### Basic Set Theory
If you want to really *understand* the axioms of $$\mathrm{ZFC}$$, this is probably the way to go. If you want additional philosophical information about the axioms, the obvious resource is Maddy's [*Believing the Axioms*](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/belaxioms1.pdf). 

A cool unexpectedly useful result is probably Mostowski's collapsing theorem. It looks like a  and I suppose $$\in$$-induction (but this is really the axiom of foundation in a trenchcoat).
